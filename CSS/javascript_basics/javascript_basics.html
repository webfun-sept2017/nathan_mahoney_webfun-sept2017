	        	<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
	        	<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibily for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a veb browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
	        	<ul>
	        		<li><p><a href="">Variable Declarations</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span> var x;</span></p></li>

	        		<li><p><a href="">Variable Assignments</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a true value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to the variable.<span> var x=10;</span></p></li>

	        		<li><p><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on varables you need to know the data types. There are six key data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- <span> true</span> or <span> false;</span> null - <span> null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span> var 42</span> or <span> 3.14159;</span> string - <span>> "Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span> [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and object - <span> {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p></li>

	        		<li><p><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statement: <span> if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span> else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span> else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>

	        		<li><p><a href="">Loops</a> There are different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile. Well, you around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</p></li>

	        		<li><p><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our functions this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are puttin together a desk from Ikea. We open up the instruction manual and get started. First we screw the legs to the table top. Next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly, ther are a ton more tables to do, so let's call our finction over and over and over again.</p></li>
